        <p class="font1">Climate change is primarily a water crisis. We feel its impacts through worsening floods,
            rising sea levels, shrinking ice fields, wildfires and droughts.</p>

        <p class="font1">However, water can fight climate change. Sustainable water management is central to building
            the resilience of societies and ecosystems and to reducing carbon emissions. Everyone has a role to play â€“
            actions at the individual and household levels are vital.</p>
        <p class="font1 ">The issue explained:</p>
        <p class="font1">Water and climate change are inextricably linked. Extreme weather events are making water more
            scarce, more unpredictable, more polluted or all three. These impacts throughout the water cycle threaten
            sustainable development, biodiversity, and people's access to water and sanitation. </p>

        <p class="font1">Flooding and rising sea levels can contaminate land and water resources with saltwater or
            faecal matter, and cause damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, such as waterpoints, wells, toilets
            and wastewater treatment facilities. </p>

        <p class="font1">Glaciers, ice caps and snow fields are rapidly disappearing. Meltwater feeds many of the great
            river systems. Volatility in the cryosphere can affect the regulation of freshwater resources for vast
            numbers of people in lowland areas.</p>

        <p class="font1">Droughts and wildfires are destabilizing communities and triggering civil unrest and migration
            in many areas. Destruction of vegetation and tree cover exacerbates soil erosion and reduces groundwater
            recharge, increasing water scarcity and food insecurity.</p>

        <p class="font1">Growing demand for water increases the need for energy-intensive water pumping, transportation,
            and treatment, and has contributed to the degradation of critical water-dependent carbon sinks such as
            peatlands. Water-intensive agriculture for food production, particularly meat, and for growing crops used as
            biofuels, can further exacerbate water scarcity.</p>
        <p class="font1">Sustainable, affordable and scalable water solutions include:</p>

        <p class="font1">Improving carbon storage: Peatlands store at least twice as much carbon as all of Earth's forests. Mangrove
            soils can sequester up to three or four times more carbon than terrestrial soils. Protecting and expanding
            these types of environments can have a major impact on climate change.</p>
        <p class="font1">Protecting natural buffers. Coastal mangroves and wetlands are effective and inexpensive
            natural barriers to flooding, extreme weather events and erosion, as the vegetation helps regulate water
            flow and binds the soil in flood plains, river banks and coastlines.</p>
        <p class="font1">Harvesting rainwater:Rainwater capture is particularly useful in regions with uneven rainfall
            distribution to build resilience to shocks and ensure supplies for dry periods. Techniques include rooftop
            capture for small-scale use and surface dams to slow run-off to reduce soil erosion and increase aquifer
            recharge.</p>
        <p class="font1">Adopting climate-smart agriculture: Using conservation techniques to improve organic matter to
            increase soil moisture retention; drip irrigation; reducing post-harvest losses and food waste; and,
            transforming waste into a source of nutrients or biofuels/biogas.</p>
        <p class="font1">Reusing wastewater:
            Unconventional water resources, such as regulated treated wastewater, can be used for irrigation and
            industrial and municipal purposes. Safely managed wastewater is an affordable and sustainable source of
            water, energy, nutrients and other recoverable materials.</p>
        <p class="font1">Harnessing groundwater:
            In many places, groundwater is over-used and polluted; in other places, it is an unknown quantity.
            Exploring, protecting and sustainably using groundwater is central to adapting to climate change and meeting
            the needs of a growing population.</p>
